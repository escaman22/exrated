    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Welcome to ExRated!</strong> We’re a parody website where you can write reviews for
      your exes. While we like to have fun, we do collect some real data — so please read this
      carefully.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">When you use ExRated, we may collect:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
      <li>Your <strong>name or username</strong></li>
      <li>Your <strong>email address</strong></li>
      <li>Any <strong>reviews or content</strong> you post about your exes</li>
      <li>
        Technical data such as your
        <strong>IP address, browser type, and device information</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    We do not actively snoop through your fridge or read your thoughts — only the stuff you choose
    to share.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      - To display your reviews on the site<br />
      - To send you occasional updates or notifications (if you opt in)<br />
      - For analytics and improving the site<br />
      - For laughs (we may read some of the reviews ourselves, strictly for entertainment purposes)
    </p>

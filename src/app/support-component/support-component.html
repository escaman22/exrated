      Welcome to ExRated Support! üíñ Whether your ex just got a brutal review, you forgot your
      password, or your heart is feeling a little heavy, we‚Äôre here to guide you‚Ä¶ sort of.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Account Issues</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      - <strong>Forgot your password?</strong> Click the "Forgot Password" link on the login page
      and follow the instructions.<br />
      - <strong>Can‚Äôt log in?</strong> Make sure you‚Äôre using the correct username/email and that
      your ex hasn‚Äôt hacked your account (we can‚Äôt help with that).<br />
      - <strong>Want to delete your account?</strong> Go to your profile settings and hit ‚ÄúDelete
      Account.‚Äù Remember: The internet never forgets, but we can at least try.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Posting Reviews</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      - Keep it real, but keep it legal. Avoid illegal content, threats, or anything that could get
      us sued.<br />
      - Reviews can be edited after posting, but don‚Äôt expect your ex to forgive you magically.<br />
      - Need to remove a review? Click the ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù button next to your post. Cry quietly if needed.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Technical Support</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      - If the site is broken, refreshing often helps. If not, report the issue by emailing
      <a href="mailto:support@exrated.com">support@exrated.com</a>.<br />
      - Include your username, a screenshot if possible, and a short description of the problem.<br />
      - We‚Äôll do our best to fix it‚Ä¶ eventually. We‚Äôre busy reading reviews too.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Emotional Support</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      - ExRated is not responsible for heartbreak, revenge plots, or tears shed over ratings.<br />
      - If your heart is in pieces, reach out to friends, family, or a professional. We recommend
      chocolate as a temporary solution.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Contact Us</h2>
